[linters]
    # This file is intended to be used by your IDE to show you what linting
    # issues exist in the code as you work on it. This list of linters will be
    # run against the files you change in a PR, but won't report problems in
    # files you don't touch.
    #
    # To see what issues will be present on just the PR files, you can run
    # golangci-lint run --new-from-rev=origin/main

    # We set all to enabled and disable the ones we don't like. This is better
    # than the reverse, because when we update golangci-lint and get more
    # linters, they'll either be noisy, and we'll know to silence them, or they
    # won't be, and it won't matter. With the reverse, you have to go looking
    # for new linters to turn on.
    enable-all = true

    enable = [
        # These are commented out because you can't use both the enable list and
        # the disable list. This is formatted like the disable list, so you can
        # move linters down to the disable list easily.

        # You can get a full list of enabled and disabled linters by running
        # golangci-lint linters, which might show more enabled linters than are
        # here, if new linters have been added recently and not referenced here.

        # "asasalint",        # check for pass []any as any in variadic func(...any)
        #                         # could be a common error, probably low false positives

        # "contextcheck",     # checks that you pas a context you already have, down into other methods
        #                     #   # this is good, so you pass down cancellation etc too.
        # "depguard",         # checks if package imports are in a list of acceptable packages
        #                         # this is useful for ensuring people use the company-standard packages for logging etc.
        # "durationcheck",    # check for two durations multiplied together
        #                         # this is probably a rare bug, but should have basically zero false positives.
        # "errchkjson",       # ensures that you check the error if you're json encoding/decoding types that could fail
        #                         # this is a fairly common error that should rarely get ignored
        # "errname",          # Checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with the Err and error types are suffixed with the Error.

        # "errorlint",        # finds code that will cause problems with the error wrapping scheme introduced in Go 1.13
        #                         # This ensures you use errors.Is instead of == to compare errors, to avoid bugs with wrapping.
        # "exportloopref",    # catch bugs resulting from referencing variables on range scope
        #                         # variables initialized in for loops change with each loop, which can cause bugs.

        #                         # This is highly configurable, see the gocritic config section below.
        # "goimports",        # check that all code is formatted with goimports
        #                         # Formating is good. goimports is better (and formats imports slightly differently than gofmt).
        # "godot",            # Check if comments end in a period
        #                         # this is a recommended Go style, and not only makes your doc comments look more
        #                         # professional, it ensures that you don't stop a comment in the middle and forget
        #                         # to write the end of it.
        # "gosec",            # Inspects source code for security problems

        #                         # this finds bugs all the time, where you assign to a value but then never use
        #                         # the assigned value due to shadowing etc.
        # "makezero",         # checks that you don't accidentally make a slice w/ nonzero length and then append to it
        #                         # this can cause bugs where you make a slice of length 5 and then append 5 items to it,
        #                         # giving you a length of 10 where the first 5 are all zero values.

        #                         # ensures that you don't typo nolint comments. and that you justify them with why you are ignoring a linter here.
